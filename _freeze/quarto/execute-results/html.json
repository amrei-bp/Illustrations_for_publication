In a literate programming document, text and code are mixed, so that the reader can understand *what* the code does and *why* it is written that way.\n\nThe concept was introduced in 1984 by Donald Knuth (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)) and is an important practice for **reproducibility** and **open science**.\n\n\n# Tools for literate programming\n\nThere are a lot of different tools for literate programming, for example Jupyter notebooks, markdown, or quarto.\n\n![](quarto.png){fig-align=\"center\" height=\"50\"}\n\nYou have already started working with **Quarto**, so we will focus on that here\n- plus it makes me happy and I want to spread the joy!\n\n# Quarto\n\n<figure style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; text-align: center;\">\n\n<img src=\"quarto_output.png\" alt=\"Quarto Output\" style=\"height: 400px;\"/>\n\n<figcaption style=\"font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;\">\n\nimage captured at https://quarto.org/\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</figure>\n\nQuarto is open source and you can edit quarto documents in a variety of editors, such as: jupyter notebooks, Visual Studio Code (more joy here, by the way), Rstudio or really any text editor.\n\nYou can use a variety of language in your quarto documents - bash, R, Python, Julia, etc.\n\nAnd last but not least you can produce a variety of output formats, such as websites (like this tutorial,) articles, presentations (like this mornings' presentation), books, dashboards.\n\n::: {style=\"clear: both;\"}\n:::\n\n# Basic syntax\n\nThis section follows the Quarto introduction tutorial available  \n[here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).\n\n[Here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) is an overview over Markdown Basics. \n\n## YAML header\n\n\n\n```{.default}\n---\ntitle: \"Hello, Quarto\"\nformat: html\neditor: visual\n---\n```\n\n\nThe YAML header appears at the top of the document and is optional. It is marked by three dashes on either end and follows the basic YAML syntax, using key-value pairs `key: value`.\n\nCommon fields in the header are \n- title\n- author\n- subtitle\n- date\n\nYou can also customise appearance and behaviour using options such as themes and fonts.\n\n[Here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) you can find the fields that are available in quarto for HTML documents.\n\n## Code Chunks\n\n\n\n````{.default}\n```{.r}\n#| label: load-packages\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n```\n````\n\n\nCode chunks can be added anywhere in the document (except inside the YAML header). Different chunks in the same document can execute different languages. Each chunk specifies the language in the curly braces at the top.\n\nChunk options are written using `#|`and control things like:\n\n- whether code or output is shown,\n- labels and captions,\n- warnings and messages.\n\nIn RStudio you can either render the entire document, or individual chunks.\n\n## Markdown Text\n\nBetween code chunks, you write regular Markdown text, such as:\n\n-   section headers (`#, ##, ###`)\n-   hyperlinks (`[in-line text](web-address)`)\n-   images\n-   inline code\n-   lists\n\nThis text is there to help you and others. It can explain why you do certain things with your data, can describe results, make comments, tell a story...\n\n## How it works\n\n![](rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png){fig-align=\"center\" height=\"120\"}\n\nWhen you render the document, **knitr** executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown, which includes code and output, as well as the text. Then, **pandoc** takes this .md file and creates the final output.\n\n# Let's try it out!\n\nIn the following exercise, you will practice literate programming using Quarto.\n\nWork with the code you used earlier (from Tuesday or Wednesday — your choice).\nMake changes, commit them, and push them to your GitHub repository.\n\nPlease make **one commit for each of the following tasks**.\n\n## 1. Quarto theme\n\nChange the theme of your file - read up on Quarto themes and apply one you like.\n\n## 2. Literate programming\n\nAre you sure you are using the full potential of quarto's literate programming capabilities?\n\nMake sure you have text for all your images, comments that explain what the code is doing...\n\n## 3. ggplot colors\n\nModify the colours in at least one plot to improve clarity or appearance.\n\n# Relevant resources\n\n## Quarto\n\n[Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/)\n\n[Awesome quarto](https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto), a collection of quarto documents to check out and get inspired by.\n\n[Quarto tricks](https://www.productive-r-workflow.com/quarto-tricks)\n\n## Color in figures\n\n[Better plots](https://better-plots.netlify.app/)\n\n[Chapter on Highlighting in Plots](https://better-plots.netlify.app/04-highlighting.html)\n\n[Practical Rules for Using Color in Charts](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/rules_for_using_color.pdf)\n\n### If you do not have code\n\nYou can use the example below:\n\n\n\n````{.default}\n---\ntitle: \"ggplot2 demo\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\ndate: \"5/22/2021\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 4\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n## Air Quality\n\n@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-airquality\n#| fig-cap: \"Temperature and ozone level.\"\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\")\n```\n````",
