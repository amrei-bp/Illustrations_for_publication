Do one commit for each of the following:\n\n# 1. Quarto theme\n\nChange the theme of your file - read up on Quarto themes and apply one you like\n\n# 2. Literate programming\n\nAre you sure you are using the full potential of quarto's literate programming capabilities?\n\nMake sure you have text for all your images, comments that explain what the code is doing...\n\n# 3. ggplot colors\n\nChange the colors of one of your images. \n\n\n\n# relevant resources\n\n## quarto\n\n[Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/)\n\n## color in illustrations\n\n[Better plots](https://better-plots.netlify.app/)\n\n[Chapter on Highlighting in Plots](https://better-plots.netlify.app/04-highlighting.html)\n\n[Practical Rules for Using Color in Charts](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/rules_for_using_color.pdf)\n\n\n\n\n\n### if you do not have code\n\nyou worked on you can use the one below:\n\n\n````{.default}\n---\ntitle: \"ggplot2 demo\"\nauthor: \"Norah Jones\"\ndate: \"5/22/2021\"\nformat: \n  html:\n    fig-width: 8\n    fig-height: 4\n    code-fold: true\n---\n\n## Air Quality\n\n@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-airquality\n#| fig-cap: \"Temperature and ozone level.\"\n#| warning: false\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\")\n```\n\n````",
