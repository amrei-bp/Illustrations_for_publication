With a version controlled project you always know which file, and even which part of the file, is the most recent, and you can even go back to older versions if you have to.\nVersion control can be used on the local system, where both the version database and the checked out file - the one that is actively being worked on - are on the local computer. Good, but the local computer can be corrupted and then the data is compromised.\nVersion control can also be centralized, where the version database is on a central server, and the active file can be checked out from several different computers. This is useful when working from different systems, or when working with collaborators. However, when the central servers is compromised the historical version are lost.\nAt last, version control can be fully distributed, with all versions of the file being on the server and different computers. Each computer checks out the file from its own version database to work on them. The databases are then synchronized between the different computers and the server. One such distributed version control system is git. It can handle everything from small to very large projects and is simple to use. GitHubis a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration, built on git.\nDistributed version control facilitates collaboration with others. Software like git automatically tracks differences in files, and flags conflicts between files.\nAdditionally, GitHub, the code hosting platform based on git that we are using in this course, can be used to maintain uniformity within a working group. The group can develop their own project template that people can use and populate for their own projects."

This is where forking comes in.\nForking a repository means creating your own copy of an existing GitHub repository under your own GitHub account. Your fork is a remote repository that you control, but it still remembers where it came from.\nYou then clone your fork to your local computer and work as usual: add, commit, push, and pull. When you are ready to share your changes, you can propose them back to the original repository by opening a pull request: a request to merge your changes into the original project.\nIn this way, forking allows collaboration without giving everyone direct write access to the same repository. It also allows for more formal collaboration, with quality checked code etc.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-git-and-clone-a-github-repository/"

For example:\n\n(p | q) / r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, p and q are first placed next to each other using |. The result is then combined with r using /, which stacks r below the first row. By grouping plots with parentheses, you can control how patchwork interprets the layout.\nBy combining operators like |, /, and +, you can gradually build up more complex figures from simple pieces, without needing to learn a separate layout language. This makes it easy to experiment with different arrangements and clearly communicate your results:\n\n(p | q | r) / s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuiztime: So how would the following plot look like?\n\np + q + r + s \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip"

    "text": "Does patchwork work with base R plots?\nNo. Patchwork only works with ggplot2 plots.\nThis is because patchwork combines plots by working with ggplot objects behind the scenes.\nBase R plots (created with functions like plot(), hist(), or boxplot()) are drawn directly to the graphics device and are not stored as objects in the same way. Because of this, patchwork cannot rearrange or combine them.\n\nWorkaround:\nWe said that patchwork only works with ggplot2 plots. That is mostly true — but there is a useful exception.\n\nold_par &lt;- par(mar = c(0, 0, 0, 0), mgp = c(1, 0.25, 0),\n    bg = NA, cex.axis = 0.75, las = 1, tcl = -0.25)\n\nplot_object &lt;- p + ~plot(penguins$flipper_length_mm, penguins$body_mass_g, main = 'Base plot')\nplot_object\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the base R plot is wrapped inside ~ (a formula). This tells patchwork to capture the output of the base plot and treat it as a graphical object, rather than a regular base plot.\nSo patchwork is not combining base plots directly. Instead, it is embedding the base plot as an element inside a patchwork layout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe base plot is not a ggplot object and cannot be modified with ggplot2 layers.\nYou cannot easily collect legends or align axes between base plots and ggplots.\nThis approach is useful for quick comparisons or demonstrations, but mixing plot systems can be limiting."
