With a version controlled project you always know which file, and even which part of the file, is the most recent, and you can even go back to older versions if you have to.\nVersion control can be used on the local system, where both the version database and the checked out file - the one that is actively being worked on - are on the local computer. Good, but the local computer can be corrupted and then the data is compromised.\nVersion control can also be centralized, where the version database is on a central server, and the active file can be checked out from several different computers. This is useful when working from different systems, or when working with collaborators. However, when the central servers is compromised the historical version are lost.\nAt last, version control can be fully distributed, with all versions of the file being on the server and different computers. Each computer checks out the file from its own version database to work on them. The databases are then synchronized between the different computers and the server. One such distributed version control system is git. It can handle everything from small to very large projects and is simple to use. GitHubis a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration, built on git.\nDistributed version control facilitates collaboration with others. Software like git automatically tracks differences in files, and flags conflicts between files.\nAdditionally, GitHub, the code hosting platform based on git that we are using in this course, can be used to maintain uniformity within a working group. The group can develop their own project template that people can use and populate for their own projects."

This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project and contains your project history.

This works well when you own the GitHub repository or have write access to it.\nIn collaborative and open-source settings, however, you often want to contribute to a repository you do not control. This is where forking comes in.\nForking a repository means creating your own copy of an existing GitHub repository under your own GitHub account. Your fork is a remote repository that you control, but it still remembers where it came from.\nYou then clone your fork to your local computer and work as usual: add, commit, push, and pull. When you are ready to share your changes, you can propose them back to the original repository by opening a pull request: a request to merge your changes into the original project.\nIn this way, forking allows collaboration without giving everyone direct write access to the same repository. It also allows for more formal collaboration, with quality checked code etc.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-install-git-and-clone-a-github-repository/"
