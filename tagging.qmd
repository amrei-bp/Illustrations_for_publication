# What is tagging?

In Git one can tag specific points in a repository’s history with an extra label, besides the commit message. This can be used to mark releases for software (`version1.0, version2.0`). 

For us it can be useful when submitting code to journals. With a tag we can freeze the code in time, so to speak, and make sure we can always find the correct version - and share it with others. 

## lightweight versus annotated

Git supports two types of tags: lightweight and annotated. 

A `lightweight tag` is pretty much just a pointer to a specific commit.

`Annotated tags` are stored as full objects in the Git database. They’re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).

# Creating a tag

We will be creating tags on Github. Alternatively, you could also create them on the command line in the terminal. 

In your repository, in the `code` tab, click on `tags`.

There are no releases, so we need to create one. Fill in the necessary detail and click `Publish release`. 

This will create a zipped archive of your repository at the time of the tagging. 

# View tags

You can access the tag via the same tag button as above, and then download the tagged version of your repository. 

In RStudio, you can pull the tag to your local repository and you will see it in the history. 

# Create a DOI for your repository

You can [issue a persistent identifier for your repository with Zenodo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content).
