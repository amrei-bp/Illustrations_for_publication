# What is tagging?

In Git one can tag specific points in a repositoryâ€™s history with an extra label, besides the commit message. This can be used to mark releases for software (`version1.0, version2.0). 

For us it can be useful when submitting code to journals. With a tag we can freeze the code in time, so to speak, and make sure we can always find the correct version - and share it with others.
