title: "Literate Programming"
---

Literate programming is a way of writing code together with explanations in a natural language (such as English). In a literate programming document, text and code are mixed, so that the reader can understand *what* the code does and *why* it is written that way.

The concept was introduced in 1984 by Donald Knuth (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)) and is an important practice for **reproducibility** and **open science**.


# Tools for literate programming

There are a lot of different tools for literate programming, for example Jupyter notebooks, markdown, or quarto.

You have already started working with **Quarto**, so we will focus on that here
- plus it makes me happy and I want to spread the joy!

# Quarto

Quarto is open source and you can edit quarto documents in a variety of editors, such as: jupyter notebooks, Visual Studio Code (more joy here, by the way), Rstudio or really any text editor.

You can use a variety of language in your quarto documents - bash, R, Python, Julia, etc.

And last but not least you can produce a variety of output formats, such as websites (like this tutorial,) articles, presentations (like this mornings' presentation), books, dashboards.

# Basic syntax

This section follows the Quarto introduction tutorial available  
[here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html).


## YAML header

```{verbatim}
---
title: "Hello, Quarto"
format: html
editor: visual
---
```

The YAML header appears at the top of the document and is optional. It is marked by three dashes on either end and follows the basic YAML syntax, using key-value pairs `key: value`.

Common fields in the header are 
- title
- author
- subtitle
- date

You can also customise appearance and behaviour using options such as themes and fonts.

[Here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html) you can find the fields that are available in quarto for HTML documents.

## Code Chunks

````{verbatim}
```{.r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
````

Code chunks can be added anywhere in the document (except inside the YAML header). Different chunks in the same document can execute different languages. Each chunk specifies the language in the curly braces at the top.

Chunk options are written using `#|`and control things like:

- whether code or output is shown,
- labels and captions,
- warnings and messages.

In RStudio you can either render the entire document, or individual chunks.

## Markdown Text

Between code chunks, you write regular Markdown text, such as:

-   section headers (`#, ##, ###`)
-   hyperlinks (`[in-line text](web-address)`)
-   images
-   inline code
-   lists

This text is there to help you and others. It can explain why you do certain things with your data, can describe results, make comments, tell a story...

## How it works

![](rstudio-qmd-how-it-works.png){fig-align="center" height="120"}

When you render the document, **knitr** executes all of the code chunks and creates a new markdown, which includes code and output, as well as the text. Then, **pandoc** takes this .md file and creates the final output.

# Let's try it out!

In the following exercise, you will practice literate programming using Quarto.

Work with the code you used earlier (from Tuesday or Wednesday — your choice).
Make changes, commit them, and push them to your GitHub repository.

Please make **one commit for each of the following tasks**.

## 1. Quarto theme

Change the theme of your file - read up on Quarto themes and apply one you like.

## 2. Literate programming

Are you sure you are using the full potential of quarto's literate programming capabilities?

Make sure you have text for all your images, comments that explain what the code is doing...

## 3. ggplot colors

Modify the colours in at least one plot to improve clarity or appearance.

### If you do not have code

You can use the example below:

````{verbatim}
---
title: "ggplot2 demo"
author: "Norah Jones"
date: "5/22/2021"
format: 
  html:
    fig-width: 8
    fig-height: 4
    code-fold: true
---

## Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature on ozone level.

```{r}
#| label: fig-airquality
#| fig-cap: "Temperature and ozone level."
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "loess")
```
